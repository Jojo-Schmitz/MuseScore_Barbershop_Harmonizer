# MuseScore_Barbershop_Harmonizer
MuseScore plugin to help harmonizing a melody in Barbershop style

## Install
Clone the repository in the `.../MusesScore3/Plugins/` resp. the `.../MusesScore4/Plugins/` folder, and enable the `bsh` plugin in the plugin manager.

## Usage
Launch from the menu : `Plugins` > `Barbershop Harmonizer` (Mu3) resp. `Plugins` > `Composing/Arranging tools` > `Barbershop Harmonizer`
The plugin pane should appear. It is recommended to dock the pane vertically on one side on MuseScore 3, MuseScore 4 doesn't support dock plugins though.
